# Headroom Studios

## Designed & Developed by Jacob Roos

## Code Institute Milestone Project 3

Headroom Studios is a site built for musicians/creatives with an added sense of community. The business provides 3 rehearsal spaces that can be rented in blocks and is supplied with all the essential equipment that would be needed (apart from the instruments).  Bookings can be made/edited on a personal profile page once the user has registered and they're also able to contribute to the noticeboard where users can post items for sale, community events and job listings!  The site was designed with a simple and intuitive layout with a focus on ensuring booking flexibility and user feedback.  A live version of the site is available [HERE](https://jacobroos87.github.io/In-a-Nutshell/).

# Responsive Design

Media queries have been added to ensure the site works well on smaller devices.  Materialize responsive classes were also used for parts of the layout.

* Home Page

The home page has a 3 column layout for 2 sections that stack for smaller devices.  The deign stays the same for tablets but collapses the navbar to a hamburger menu.

* Rehearsal Studios

The rehearsal studio page also keeps the 3 column layout and has the same principle applied for continuity.  Smaller devices stack and for tablet the design stays the same but changer the navbar to a hamburger menu.

* Notice Board

The notice board has responsive sizing so adapts to the viewport.  The posts in the notice board stay stacked with the only design change for smaller devices being the footer elements stacking which is the same for all pages.

* FAQ

The FAQ page is based around Materialize collapsible popout elements.  The design layout stays the same for all devices.  The collapsibles are in responsive containers.

* Contact

The form inside this section changes depending on the device and the text is also scaled down.

* Log In

The log in form is in a responsive container that resizes depending on the device.  I've also added media queries to extend the width for mobile devices.

* Register

The form inside the modal scales with devices and also increases in width for mobiles.

* Bookings

The bookings page has a 2 column layout that stacks for smaller devices.  The availability form has 2 inputs that are inline for larger devices and tablets but stack for mobiles.  The same priciple was applied to the lower booking form which has 3 elements that stack for mobile devices.

* Profile

The user profile page has a simle username title followed by active bookings.  For desktop devices a 3 column layout is used.  For tablets this scales down to 2 and mobiles to 1.

* New Post

The form inside this section is in a responsive container and scales for smaller devices.

* Admin (Admin only)

This admin page has the same concept as the profile pages.  Larger devices are 3 columns, tablets 2 and mobiles one.

* Log Out

The log out tab doesn't go to a separate page.  It simply logs the user out and returns them to the log in page.

# Colours & Fonts

## Colours

The colours for the site were decided based on competitor sites and also taking into consideration current colour trends. The pallette consists of a light teal green, black, wite, charcoal and a flash of orange.

The fonts all remain black and white for contrast and to improve readability.  

## Fonts

The fonts that were used on the site are "**Bungee**" and "**Roboto**".  The style of the Bungee font was inline with the slightly darker vibe and worked well as a standalone Logo font.  Roboto is a modern easy to read font that was complimentary to the bungee logo font.
